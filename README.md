# Final-1st-Unit Game Project

My game is called "Cupcake Fantasy". It requires a single playable character to move around the screen in order to collect cupcakes that fall from the sky at random locations. THe charatcer has to collect at least 15 cupcakes in a matter of 2 minutes or the character loses the game. Players can also compete against each other to see who scores the highest and if they can collect more than the required minimum amount of cupcakes. Players also have a chance to immediately play the game again once it ends.

Description from the game: The goal is to collect as many cupcakes as possible to save yPeach's bakery. Peach was delivering goods around the neighborshood one day when it suddenly started raining cupcakes straight from the sky!! 
        It seems as if Peach decided that collecting the cupcakes was a good way to make money and save the bakery!! However,you as Peach are still required to perfectly catch at
        least 50 cupcakes withoutt letting them fall to the ground. 
        The cupcakes will all be sold to Mario and Luigi, who are celebrating Mario's birthday!! If you manage to catch all 50 and 
        delivers them to the birthday party,
        then enough money can be made to save Peach's bakery! If you are unable to to catch all 50 in a row within 2 minutes, 
        then the game will end and the task is not completed.
