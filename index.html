  <h2>Directions:Try to get as many cupcakes as you can before time runs out!!</h2>
    <h3>
        The goal is to collect as many cupcakes as possible to save Peach's bakery. Peach was delivering goods around the neighborhood one day when it 
        suddenly started raining cupcakes!! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Peach decided that collecting the cupcakes was a good way to make money and save her bakery!! 
        <br>
        The main catch is to catch as many cupcakes as you can without letting them fall to the ground. 
        All the collected cupcakes will be sold at night, during Mario's birthday party!! 
        Hurry, the party starts soon!!
        Catch as many cupcakes as you can within 2 minutes!
        <br>
